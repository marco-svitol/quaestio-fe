# Getting Started with Patent Query App

The Patent Query App is a web application that allows users to search for and view patent data. The app features a search box where users can enter their desired search parameters. When a user submits a query, the app sends a request to a back-end API, which returns a list of relevant patent data. This data is then displayed in a results table, which is paginated to improve readability and navigation.

The results table displays the following information for each patent: title, number, inventor name, and date. Additionally, there is a link to the Open Patent Services (OPS) website, where users can view additional information about the patent.

Users can navigate between pages of the results table using the PageSelector component, which is located at the bottom of the table. The PageSelector allows users to move between different pages of the results and to set the number of items per page they want to see.

In summary, the Patent Query App provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for searching and viewing patent data. The ability to filter results by specific search parameters and the pagination feature of the results table make it easy for users to find the information they need.
